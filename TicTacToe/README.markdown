**Tic Tac Toe**

This is a very basic Ruby console version of Tic Tac Toe

In tic_tac_toe.rb you can setup if the players are human or computer controlled. You can play the computer or have the computer play itself. 

There are no required gems.

To run, use the following

    ruby tic_tac_toe.rb

I'm still learning Ruby so it probably isn't written the best way, so any comments are welcome (please go easy on me). There are some tests (not full TDD), I'm learning about this too.
