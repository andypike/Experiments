**Twatter**

Twatter is a very basic console Twitter client.

Twatter is my very first Ruby application so it probably isn't written the best way, so any comments are welcome.

Here are the supported commands:

* exit => Exits the application
* help => Displays this help list
* login => Prompts you for your Twitter user name and password. If valid, these are cached for other commands
* friends_timeline => Lists the latest 20 tweets from you and your friends
* tweet => Send a new tweet to share with the world upto a maximum of 140 characters
* followers => Lists up to 100 of your followers
* mentions => Lists the latest 20 tweets that contain your user name
* dms => Lists the latest 20 direct messages sent to you
* favorites => Lists the latest 20 tweets that you have marked as your favorite
* follow => Allows you to follow a new friend
* unfollow => Allows you to stop following a friend
* following => Lists up to 100 friends that you are followering

Twatter requires the following gems:

* gem install json
